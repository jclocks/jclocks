- 👋 Hi, I’m @jclocks, I'm a Support Engineer for an IT vendor in the Northeast US.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing developer skills and possibly making some cool projects along the way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (primarily), and have some practice with PHP, SQL, and Bash. Looking to also learn Go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects looking for help. I particularly enjoy smaller, more "indie" projects.
